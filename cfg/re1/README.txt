Welcome to ManaTracker

TO RUN:
 - Start Resident Evil 1 HD Remake
 - Start ManaServer (the shortcut in this directory or ManaServer/ManaServer.exe)
 - Start ManaTracker (the shortcut in this directory or ManaTracker/ManaTracker.exe)
 - In a web browser, go to localhost:8080 to view the app


Note: RE1 must be running when you start ManaServer.
ManaTracker, on the other hand, can be run on its own so you can configure it.
If ManaServer is not running, all items in the tracker will appear "active".

Currently, to reset the tracker you'll need to exit and restart ManaTracker.
You do not need to restart ManaServer, though.


TO CONFIGURE:
To customize how ManaTracker appears in the browser and other options,
you can make changes in cfg/re1/cfg.yaml
You can change which items are tracked, rearrange them, add or customize the displayed names, etc.

Note: You'll need to restart ManaTracker for the changes to apply.


Don't hesitate to reach out if you need help, run into problems, or have feedback!
