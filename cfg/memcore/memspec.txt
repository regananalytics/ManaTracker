        [Version]:
            DESCRIPTION: A description of the game version.
            HASH: The hash of the game executable, used to identify the running version.
            ADDRESSES: Dictionary of named keys and hex addresses for game pointers.

                [Address Key]: <Hex Memory Address>
                
    STATE_POINTERS: 
        [Pointer Name]:
            DESCRIPTION: A description of the pointer.
            ADDRESS: The hex memory address of the pointer. Can be Hex or a reference to a game version address.
            LEVELS: Multilevel pointer offsets. Each level is a hex offset from the previous level.
                - <Hex Offset>
                - <Hex Offset>
            OFFSET: The hex offset from the final level pointer.
            TYPE: The data type for the pointer. Can be a basic type, or the name of a struct.

        [Struct Name]:
            DESCRIPTION: A description of the struct.
            FIELDS:
                # Dictionary of named keys and hex offsets for struct fields.
                [Field Name]:
                    DESCRIPTION: A description of the field.
                    OFFSET: The hex offset from the struct pointer.
                    TYPE: The data type for the field. Can be a basic type, or the name of a struct.
                    DEFAULT: The default value for the field.
